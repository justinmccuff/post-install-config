<p>
When configuring user roles, it is advisable to access the 'Admin Panel,' located in the upper right-hand corner. Subsequently, navigate to the 'Agents' section and proceed to 'Roles.' As depicted above, you can observe the roles that I have meticulously crafted and assigned to various members within my team, aligning with their respective departments. Each role has been thoughtfully tailored to grant distinct levels of access and clearance.

<h2>SLA </h2>

<p>
Here, we present the essential aspects of SLA (Service Level Agreement) configuration, a foundational element universally employed by businesses. SLAs generally adhere to a common framework, encompassing three distinct categories: Customer SLAs, Internal SLAs, and Multilevel SLAs.

A Service Level Agreement constitutes a formal understanding between a service provider and their clientele. The prioritization of SLAs hinges upon the severity of support tickets, which can be automatically generated by the system or designated by a supervisor.

These SLAs are bound by stringent timeframes, as exemplified in the illustration above, underscoring the commitment to timely and efficient service delivery.

<h2>Help Topics </h2>

<p>
Presented here are vital Help Desk Topics. To configure these topics effectively, you can initiate the process by accessing the 'Admin Panel,' situated at the upper-right corner of the interface. Subsequently, proceed to the 'Manage' tab, and from there, navigate to the 'Help Topics' section.

The implementation of Help Topics is pivotal in optimizing the end-user's help desk experience, guaranteeing seamless ticket assignment and swift responses. You have the flexibility to create an array of Help Topics to suit your specific needs, even nesting them within one another to facilitate further categorization.

Help Topics play a pivotal role in determining the department to which a ticket is routed, subsequently dictating the agents' access to that ticket. Additionally, these topics influence various ticket configurations, such as the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and ticket priority, ranging from emergency to low, ensuring a comprehensive approach to ticket management."
